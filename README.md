I led a complex project focused on developing and implementing an integrated electronic system, meeting predefined requirements in two distinct parts:
Part 1: Central Unit and Memories consisting of the development and integration of the central unit, including EPROM and SRAM memory modules and configuration of serial and parallel interfaces for communication and display.
Part 2: Interfaces and Output Devices consisting of implementing 24 LEDs and a 7-segment display the integration of a keypad for interaction and control and an LCD module for display.
The project required meticulous planning, design and integration to ensure the proper functioning of each component.
